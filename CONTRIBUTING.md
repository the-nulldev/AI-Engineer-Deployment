## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- Git installed on your computer.

## Basic knowledge of Git (clone, commit, push, pull).

1. Create the Repository - One student (or the teacher) should:

- Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. llm-evals-deployment).
- Add collaborators in Settings > Collaborators (if using a private repo).

2. Clone the Repository- Each team member should clone the repository to their local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/llm-evals-deployment.git
cd llm-evals-deployment
```

3. Create a new branch for your work -- always create a new branch to work on a specific feature or task.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-fastapi-endpoint
```

Use descriptive names like feature/, bugfix/, or refactor/.

4. Make your changes locally — implement your feature or fix. Use meaningful commit messages.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add FastAPI /ask endpoint"
```

5. Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/add-fastapi-endpoint
```

6. Open a Pull Request (PR). This is a request to merge your changes into the main branch.

- Go to GitHub and:
    - Click Compare & pull request.
    - Write a clear title and description:
        - What the PR is about — that is, what does it address?
        - How you went about solving the problem and why you chose that approach (this usually makes it easier for the reviewer to know why you did what)
        - Add labels like "enhancement", "bugfix", etc. — these specify what the PR is about at a glance, allow categorizations, prioritization, and can also be used to trigger automations like in CI/CD pipelines.

7. Review Each Other's Code

- Go to the Pull Request tab.
    - Click on the PR you want to review.
    - Check the "Files changed" tab to see what has been modified.
    - Read the code and comment if needed.
    - If necessary, run the code locally to test it.
    - If you find issues, leave comments on specific lines.
    - If everything looks good, approve the PR.
    - Click on the "Review changes" button and select one of the options:
        - Approve: If everything is fine.
        - Request changes: If you find issues that need to be fixed.
        - Comment: If you have questions or suggestions but don't want to block the merge.
    - When ready, click Merge to add it to the main branch.

8. Sync with Main Branch Regularly

- Before starting new work:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

- This ensures you have the latest changes from the `main` branch.
- If you have uncommitted changes, stash them first:

```bash
git stash
```
- Then create a new branch from up-to-date `main`.
- After pulling, you can reapply your stashed changes:

```bash
git stash apply
```

9. Avoid Merge Conflicts

- Communicate regularly.
- Don’t work on the same files in parallel.
- Pull and push often.

10. GitHub repository deliverable. GitHub repo with:

- Final code solution in the `main` branch.
- At least three merged pull requests.
- At least five closed Issues linked to PRs or labeled as `wonfix/invalid`.

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Use branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments.
- Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., feature/add-dockerfile, bugfix/fix-api-endpoint).
- Keep Pull Requests small and focused.
- Review before merging.
- Don't commit .idea/ or build/ directories.
- Use .gitignore properly.
